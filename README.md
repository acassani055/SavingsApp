# InfluentialBigHamster
Built for Durhack 2023

## Inspiration
Our inspiration comes from the games industry; specifically, from games like AdVenture Capitalist which showed us that a game doesn't have to have complex animations in order for them to be fun. We combined a similar style to this with a simulation of the real world to make a fun and educational game.

## What it does
Money The Game is a simulation of how money works in real life, simplified and gamified to attract 10-14 year olds. Players start off with a certain amount saved, a certain level of income, as well as food & rent bills that must be payed at various times. Their goal is to try and "level up" which they can do by purchasing different houses. However, in order to increase their income, they must take courses which cost money and and decrease their happiness. They must also ensure that they are sufficiently happy to stress the point that money should never be ones sole focus. By levelling up, earning money and keeping themselves happy they can climb the leaderboard and compete with all other players from around the globe incentivising them to learn more with the competitive edge.

## How we built it
We started with drawing an initial mock-up on a whiteboard to understand the rules and structure of the game. We then divided up the project into different tasks and each of us started developing our assigned tasks. We used GitHub to organise our work and ensure that all our code integrated well together.

## Challenges we ran into
As with any project, we ran into many challenges the most apparent being conflicts whilst merging code. With all 4 of us working on different parts, it was sometimes difficult to understand which file was where. We also faced trouble trying to get the game logic to work. We found that the gameplay was sometimes too easy, too hard, or plainly just didn't work.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Successfully designed and implemented an educational game. At no point did we feel completely lost in what we had to do and we where good at delegating tasks so each of us contributed an equal and valuable amount.

## What we learned
JavaScript refresher, responsive web design, sequelize npm library
